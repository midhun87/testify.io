                <h2>4. Platform Services</h2>
                <h3>4.1. Proctored Tests & Interviews</h3>
                <p>The Platform provides AI-proctored tests and interviews to maintain academic integrity. During these sessions, the system may monitor your video and audio feed in real-time. Any violation of test rules (e.g., presence of another person, use of unauthorized devices, excessive background noise) may result in penalties, including immediate termination of the test and a report of the violation to the test administrator.</p>
                <h3>4.2. Courses & Learning Materials</h3>
                <p>All courses, including text, videos, and associated materials, are the intellectual property of TESTIFY or its licensors. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and view the course materials for your personal, non-commercial use. You may not reproduce, redistribute, or sell any course content.</p>
                <h3>4.3. Code Compilation Service</h3>
                <p>The Platform includes a code compilation service for practice and assessment. You agree to use this service only for its intended purpose. You shall not submit any code that is malicious, infringes on intellectual property rights, or is designed to disrupt the service. Your code may be transmitted to a third-party service for compilation and execution.</p>

                <h2>5. Data Privacy & Security</h2>
                <h3>5.1. AI Proctoring and Face Verification</h3>
                <p>Our commitment to your privacy is paramount. For AI proctoring and face verification:</p>
                <ul class="space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>No Media Storage:</strong> During a live proctoring session, your video and audio stream are analyzed in real-time and are <strong>not stored</strong> on our servers. The data is processed and immediately discarded.</li>
                    <li><strong>Violation Logging:</strong> If a potential violation is detected, the system logs only the type of violation and the timestamp. No images, video clips, or audio recordings are stored.</li>
                    <li><strong>Face Verification:</strong> To ensure your identity, we use a face verification system. This requires an initial profile image upload. During a test, the system compares your live video feed against this stored profile image. This process is automated, and the comparison data is not permanently stored.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>5.2. General Data Handling</h3>
                <p>We collect and store information necessary for the functioning of the platform, including your profile information, test answers, course progress, and violation logs. We implement robust security measures, including encryption and access controls, to protect your data.</p>
                <h3>5.3. Third-Party Services Disclosure</h3>
                <p>We utilize several third-party services to provide our platform's functionality. By using our Platform, you acknowledge that your data may be processed by these services. These include:</p>
                <ul class="space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS):</strong> For database hosting (DynamoDB) and facial recognition (Rekognition).</li>
                    <li><strong>Cloudinary:</strong> For secure storage of your profile image and other platform-related media.</li>
                    <li><strong>Google Gemini:</strong> For AI-powered generation of test and course content.</li>
                    <li><strong>Paiza.io:</strong> For executing and compiling code submitted through our code compiler service.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party services.</p>

                <h2>6. User Generated Content</h2>
                <p>You retain ownership of the content you submit, such as test answers and code ("User Content"). However, by submitting User Content, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, and display this content in connection with providing the Platform services.</p>

                <h2>8. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2>
