                <p>Welcome to TESTIFY. By using our platform, you agree to these Terms & Conditions. This document outlines your rights and responsibilities and, most importantly, our commitment to your data privacy and safety.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">1. Data Privacy and AI Proctoring</h2>
                <p>Your privacy and the security of your data are our highest priorities. We have designed TESTIFY with a core principle of "data minimalism" when it comes to live AI proctoring. </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                    <li><strong>No Data Storage:</strong> During a live test, the AI proctoring system analyzes your video and audio stream in real-time. We **do not** store any video recordings, audio, or images of you during the proctoring session. The AI models process the data live and then discard it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Live Analysis Only:</strong> The AI's sole purpose is to detect potential violations (e.g., a phone, a second person, or background noise) based on predefined parameters. This analysis is conducted live on the platform without saving any of the input media.</li>
                    <li><strong>Violation Data:</strong> If a violation is detected, the system will only log the **type of violation** (e.g., "phone detected," "person not present," or "excessive noise"). No image, video, or audio evidence is stored or sent to the test administrator. The violation log serves as a flag for review and is not a record of your live session.</li>
                    <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> All AI processing is performed locally within the secure test environment. The AI models are loaded and run within your browser, ensuring your data is not transmitted to our servers for analysis.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">2. Website Security and Data Safety</h2>
                <p>We are committed to providing a secure and safe environment for all our users. We implement multiple layers of security to protect your information, including:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                    <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> All data transmitted between your browser and our servers is encrypted using industry-standard protocols to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
                    <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> We enforce strict access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Regular Audits:</strong> Our systems undergo regular security audits to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> We only collect the data necessary to provide our services and do not store any information we don't need.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secure Authentication:</strong> We use industry-standard secure authentication methods to protect your account and personal information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Incident Response:</strong> We have an incident response plan in place to quickly and effectively address any potential security breaches.</li>
                    <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> We adhere to relevant data protection and privacy laws and regulations to ensure the highest standards of data safety.</li>
                    <li><strong>Continuous Monitoring:</strong> Our security systems are continuously monitored to detect and prevent any malicious activity.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">3. Your Responsibilities</h2>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                    <li>You must provide accurate and complete registration information.</li>
                    <li>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account password.</li>
                    <li>You must not share your login credentials with anyone else.</li>
                    <li>You must follow all instructions during a proctored test. Failure to do so may result in your test being automatically submitted.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">4. Limitation of Liability</h2>
